## Frame 4 — Step 2: Chunk and embed

- scene: Same pipeline stage, node 2 lights — a document slices into 400-word chunks, each chunk turns into a column of numbers, and drops into a Postgres + pgvector cylinder
- voiceover: "Next, it splits each document into chunks — turns each chunk into numbers that capture its meaning — and stores them in Postgres with pgvector."

- src: compositions/frames/04-embed.html
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Concretization + progressive disclosure
- beat: comprehension + "aha"
- blueprint: compose
- focal: a chunk turning into a column of numbers
- roles: pipeline rail (step 2 lit) = supporting chrome · document card = foreground (left) · four chunk cards = foreground · number columns = foreground subject · "Postgres + pgvector" database card = foreground (right)
- sfx: whoosh-short, click, pop

narrativeRole: Explains embeddings in plain terms — meaning becomes numbers that a database can search.
keyMessage: Every chunk becomes a 1536-number vector stored in one Postgres database.

Compose: a three-stage transform, left to right — document → chunks → vectors → database.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.2s): step 01 fades to done (0.55), 02 CHUNK & EMBED fills cobalt; eyebrow "STEP 2 · CHUNK & EMBED". A document card sits in the left third.
Scene 2 (1.2–3.5s): on "splits each document into chunks", the document card slices horizontally into four stacked chunk cards that spread apart slightly; a small label reads "400 words · 50 overlap" (staggered reveal).
Scene 3 (3.5–6.1s): on "numbers that capture its meaning", each chunk card flips and decodes into a narrow column of numbers like "0.021 / −0.113 / 0.087 / …" (3D char flip-decode → `hacker-flip-3d`), with a cobalt numeral label "1536 numbers per chunk" and a muted line "text-embedding-3-small".
Scene 4 (6.1–9.2s): on "Postgres with pgvector", the four columns slide right into a rounded database card (cylinder outline drawn with `svg-path-draw`) labelled "Postgres + pgvector" with the sub-label "HNSW cosine index". Hold still.

# Hacker Flip 3D Reveal

Characters flip down from 90° in 3D while cycling through pseudo-random glyphs, then settle on the target character — a "decryption" / airport flap-display reveal. Resolves to a short target word (typically a brand or label).

## How It Works

Each character gets its own per-char tween from `rotateX: 90deg` (hidden, hinged at the bottom edge) to `0deg` (upright), staggered across the word. Below `REVEAL_THRESHOLD` progress the char displays a seeded pseudo-random glyph that reshuffles every few frames; past it, the real target character clicks into place — so the eye catches the right letter just as the flip settles. A hidden ghost copy of the full word reserves layout width so narrow flicker glyphs never shift the line.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="hacker-text-wrap" id="hacker-text" data-target="{phrase}">
  <!-- ghost row + per-char spans injected by the setup script -->
</div>
```

```css
/* the scene root (or nearest 3D ancestor) MUST set perspective: 1500px */
.hacker-text-wrap {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace so flicker glyphs hold width */
  font-weight: 900;
  font-size: HACKER_FONT_SIZE;
  position: relative; /* ghost stacks absolutely behind the live row */
}
.hacker-char {
  display: inline-block;
  transform-origin: bottom; /* flap-display hinge */
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}
.hacker-ghost {
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 auto auto 0;
}
```

```js
const wrap = document.getElementById("hacker-text");
const targetWord = wrap.dataset.target;
const GLYPHS = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%&*";

// Ghost row (reserves width) + live per-char spans
const ghost = document.createElement("div");
ghost.className = "hacker-ghost";
ghost.textContent = targetWord;
wrap.appendChild(ghost);
const charEls = [...targetWord].map((ch) => {
  const span = document.createElement("span");
  span.className = "hacker-char";
  span.textContent = ch === " " ? " " : ch;
  span.dataset.target = ch;
  wrap.appendChild(span);
  return span;
});

// Index-seeded hash — same frame always yields the same glyph
function pseudoGlyph(seed) {
  const h = ((seed * 9301 + 49297) % 233280) / 233280;
  return GLYPHS[Math.floor(h * GLYPHS.length)];
}

charEls.forEach((el, i) => {
  const state = { p: 0 };
  tl.to(
    state,
    {
      p: 1,
      duration: FLIP_DURATION,
      ease: "power3.out",
      onUpdate: () => {
        if (state.p < REVEAL_THRESHOLD) {
          el.textContent = pseudoGlyph(i * 1000 + Math.floor(state.p * 100));
        } else {
          el.textContent = el.dataset.target === " " ? " " : el.dataset.target;
        }
        el.style.transform = `rotateX(${90 - state.p * 90}deg)`;
        el.style.opacity = Math.min(1, state.p * 2);
      },
    },
    i * CHAR_STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Top-down hinge** — `transform-origin: top` for a falling-flap look.
- **Center spin** — `transform-origin: center` reads as a barrel roll, not a flap.
- **Number-only pool** — restrict `GLYPHS` to digits for a price / countdown decode.
- **Two-pass decode** — chain two `FLIP_DURATION` tweens with different glyph pools (symbols → letters → real) for a longer reveal.

## Values

| token            | range                           | notes                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HACKER_FONT_SIZE | 6–10% of viewport min-dimension | the flip IS the focal beat; ghost must use the identical size                      |
| FLIP_DURATION    | 0.4–1.0s                        | under 0.4s the flicker phase has no time; over 1.0s drags                          |
| CHAR_STAGGER     | 0.03–0.08s                      | total decode = `CHAR_STAGGER × (chars − 1) + FLIP_DURATION` — fit the phase budget |
| REVEAL_THRESHOLD | 0.5–0.7                         | lower reveals too early (no tension); higher reads as a hard end-reveal            |
| FLICKER_RATE     | 3–6 frames per glyph swap       | <3 looks like noise; >6 looks like discrete typing                                 |

Reference: `../examples/proof-logo-chain.html` (163px, 0.55s, 0.033s, 0.6).

## Critical Constraints

- **`perspective` on the scene root REQUIRED** — without parent perspective, `rotateX` renders as a 2D squash, not a 3D flip; `transform-style: preserve-3d` on each char.
- **Ghost placeholder** with identical content + font must back the live chars — without it, narrow glyphs shift the layout mid-flicker (monospace preferred; the ghost makes a proportional face recoverable).
- **Flicker seed = char index + quantized progress** — the same frame must show the same glyph.
- **Flicker rate ≥ ~3 frames per swap**; `onUpdate` work stays O(1) per char per frame.
- **Center the flip dead-center and add NO decorative chrome** (timestamp lines, "// AUTH" tags, status dots) — the flip is the beat. A necessary secondary label is BIG typography (56–72px caps + tracking) in the same stack, never a tiny corner annotation.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
