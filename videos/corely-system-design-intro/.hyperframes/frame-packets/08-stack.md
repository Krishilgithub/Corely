narrativeRole: Zooms out from the flow to the whole system, showing how simple the footprint is.
keyMessage: The architecture is small: one app, one database, one container setup.

Adapt: keep the one continuous decelerating zoom-out signature; the "workspace" revealed is the architecture map.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.4s): open tight on the five-step pipeline rail (all steps done); one continuous decelerating zoom-out (→ `multi-phase-camera`) reveals the rail sits inside a rounded box labelled "Next.js 15 app · one Node process" with three inner rows: "Dashboard", "59 API routes", "Connectors".
Scene 2 (1.4–3.0s): on "one Postgres database", a database card "Postgres + pgvector · Supabase" draws in to the right with a cobalt link line; a smaller "OpenAI · embeddings + gpt-4o" card and a dashed "Redis · optional" card appear beside it.
Scene 3 (3.0–4.9s): on "packaged in Docker", a dashed outer frame draws around the app and Redis, tagged "docker compose" (→ `svg-path-draw`). Centered map ~70% of frame, hold.

## Selected blueprint: zoom-out-workspace-reveal

# zoom-out-workspace-reveal — Zoom-Out Workspace Reveal

**intent**: Open TIGHT on one full-bleed detail — a graphic macro or a small UI region — let micro-action play in close-up, then ONE continuous decelerating zoom-out reveals that everything seen so far lives inside a containing whole (a design-tool workspace / a multi-pane agent workspace); the frame locks at the wide and element-level payoff carries on. The zoom-out IS the narrative engine and the reveal-of-nesting is the payoff — distinct from `grid-card-assemble`, where a zoom-OUT is an optional camera modifier garnishing an element-stagger assemble; here nothing assembles, the world was whole all along, and the single outward move is what re-scopes its meaning. The structural inverse of every existing push-in shape (`constellation-hub`'s push-in, `device-surface-showcase`'s continuous push, `dataviz-countup`'s push-through).

**roles served**

- Hook (from `continuous-zoomout-nesting-reveal`): when the open should be a full-bleed graphic mystery — a blob morphing, a macro blossom blooming — resolved by one unbroken exponentially-decelerating zoom-out that passes THROUGH an intermediate composition (oversized headline / card artwork / web page) before revealing the whole thing is an artboard inside a design tool (panels, layers, inspector, timeline); the frame locks and the canvas keeps animating, ending mid-action.
- Benefits (from `close-up-open-single-zoom-out-reveal`): when the payoff is scale/breadth — micro-actions play in extreme close-up on one small UI region (file rows popping in, a highlight stepping, a guided glide down a list), then ONE fast smoothly-decelerating zoom-out (~0.5–1s) reveals the region was a corner of a huge multi-pane agent workspace (chat + artifact preview + sidebar); the wide holds static to the end while element-level payoff completes the story ("look how much the agent did — and here's the deliverable").

**duration**: 6.8–11s (Hook continuous-pull both 6.8s; Benefits dwell-then-snap 10.7–11s — the dwell and the post-lock payoff stretch, the reveal itself does not)

**HARD RULE — no zoom-in anywhere; camera static outside the single reveal.** Carried verbatim from both Benefits goldens and structurally true of both Hook goldens: the camera's only scale motion is OUTWARD. One zoom-out per shot. Before the reveal the camera either holds, glides/pans along the close-up surface, or is already running the (only) pull-back; after the reveal decelerates to a full stop the frame is LOCKED — every later change (pane swap, pane expansion, cursor travel, playhead scrub, canvas animation) is element/layout motion, never camera. No push-in, no punch, no re-zoom, no second reveal. Violating this collapses the shape back into a generic camera tour.

**shot structure** (one oversized static world — the full `[whole: workspace]` authored at final layout from frame 0 — with the camera starting scaled far in on the `[detail]`; the reveal is one scale animation on the world; two folded sub-shapes — **(A) continuous nesting pull** (Hook) and **(B) close-up dwell → snap reveal** (Benefits))

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~2.5s) — full-bleed detail + micro-action.** Extreme close-up: the `[detail: graphic macro — blob / blossom stem / small UI region — file list / browser corner]` fills the frame edge-to-edge with NO containing chrome, canvas, or neighboring panes visible. The detail PERFORMS in close-up — this beat is never a static hold:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: the graphic itself moves/morphs/blooms — an organic `[accent]` blob flows across and morphs into an undulating wavy line, or blurred macro forms sharpen as circular petals pop and expand outward into a flat vector `[motif]` — while the pull-back is ALREADY running underneath (the camera never waits).
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: camera holds (or glides) while UI micro-action plays — `[rows: filenames / list items]` pop in top-to-bottom, a soft `[highlight]` steps down row-by-row, or the camera rides down a list while gently pulling back. Optional blur-to-sharp resolve on the opening frame.

- **Scene 2 (~2.5s–reveal start) — the middle beat.** Diverges by sub-shape:
  - _Variant — Hook (A) — intermediate nesting level_: the continuing zoom-out resolves a mid-level composition, still full-bleed, still no chrome — oversized `[headline]` glyphs descend into frame as partial letterforms and settle centered (the "descent" is pure world-scale: the letters are static in world space, the camera pull produces the motion), or the `[motif]` is revealed living inside a `[card]` in a row of cards on a `[web page]`. The viewer re-scopes once — and still doesn't know the real container.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B) — close-up beat advances_: the close-up story develops at the same tightness — the view shifts to an adjacent `[panel]`, a new `[row]` fades/slides in and grows its panel, a `[cursor]` enters and hovers it with a soft highlight. This is the pre-reveal dwell; tension is "we're deep inside something."

- **Scene 3 (the reveal) — ONE decelerating zoom-out completes; frame LOCKS.** The signature move. The camera pulls back to scale 1 and eases to a full stop, revealing the containing `[whole]`:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: the pull is the tail of the SAME continuous zoom running since frame 0 (total travel ~4.3–4.5s of a 6.8s shot), with strong exponential deceleration — the `[intermediate composition]` turns out to be `[an artboard / a phone-screen mock]` on a `[design-tool canvas]`: light chrome, left pages/layers panel, right properties inspector, blue selection box, bottom animation timeline with keyframe bars.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: the pull is a discrete rapid burst (~0.5–1s) from the held close-up — smooth, heavily decelerating — landing the full `[multi-pane agent workspace]`: left `[chat pane]` with the prompt + status + response, center/right `[artifact pane: spreadsheet / deck preview]`, optional `[sidebar: progress checklist + artifacts + context]`.
  - Both: the zoom-out ends BEFORE the shot does — always leave a post-lock act. The deceleration-to-stop is what makes the lock legible.

- **Scene 4 (lock–end) — element-level payoff on the locked wide.** The reveal is not the ending; the close-up's world keeps living inside the wide. All motion is element/layout:
  - _Variant — Hook (A)_: a `[cursor]` enters from off-frame and glides to hover/click the selected element, or a `[playhead]` scrubs left-to-right across the bottom timeline while the canvas artwork animates in sync (petals rotate about their hub, a starburst spins in place, a motif sweeps/shifts). Ends MID-ACTION — the tool is alive.
  - _Variant — Benefits (B)_: a `[file-attachment card]` fades in → the cursor clicks `[Open]` → the artifact pane swaps content via a quick white-out → the viewer pane expands full-width over its neighbor (LAYOUT motion, not camera) landing on the `[deliverable: full slide / dashboard]`; or the frame simply holds long and static while the cursor drifts to rest near the `[payoff stat]`. Struck-through checklist items in the sidebar read as completed work. Long hold to the end.

**motion vocabulary**: one continuous scale-driven zoom-out with exponential/eased deceleration (no cuts) · single fast decelerating zoom-out burst (~0.5–1s) · workspace-lock at zoom end · full-bleed no-chrome opening · blur-to-sharp macro focus resolve · organic blob flow + morph into undulating wavy line · squiggle-underline settle with residual undulation · circular petals popping/expanding outward (bloom) · oversized letters descending into frame as partial glyphs (world-scale, not element motion) · text scaling down through the frame to a centered settle · rows pop in top-to-bottom · selection highlight steps down row-by-row · camera rides/pans down a list while pulling back · new row fades/slides in and grows its panel · cursor hover with soft row highlight · cursor entering from off-frame and gliding to hover/click · timeline playhead scrub left-to-right · in-canvas rotation about a hub / spin-in-place · motif shift/sweep-in · file-attachment card fade-in · cursor click · pane content swap via quick white-out · pane expands full-width over neighbor (layout motion) · checklist items shown struck-through · long static hold · cursor drift to rest · ends mid-action (Hook).

**rule mapping** (motion verb → `rule-id`)

- the single decelerating zoom-out on the whole world → `viewport-change` (one `.world` wrapper; `cam` object as single source of truth via `onUpdate`; start `cam.scale` at the reveal ratio with `T = -offset × S` centering the detail, tween scale → 1 and translate → 0 with ONE shared ease — the detail drifts from frame-center to its home slot as the wide takes over, exactly the golden read)
- off-center detail framed at open, zoom-out to wide → `coordinate-target-zoom` ("Zoom out (target → wide view)" variation — nested wrappers, reverse phases: start zoomed on the measured target, tween outer scale → 1 + inner translate → 0 with shared duration/ease; measure the detail's center after `fonts.ready`, never hand-derive)
- pre-reveal glide/ride down a list while gently pulling back (Benefits B) → `viewport-change` (pan + scale composed on the one `cam` object) — sequencing the slow-glide → hold → fast-pull profile → `multi-phase-camera` (phase machinery; this shape runs the same scale-agnostic math at 4–12× outward — see `viewport-change`'s scale-guide range note)
- exponential deceleration-to-stop → ease selection (`expo.out` / `power4.out` on the reveal tween) — parameter guidance, no rule needed; after the stop, NO camera tweens exist on the timeline (hard rule above)
- blur-to-sharp macro resolve chorded to the early pull → `depth-of-field-blur` (refocus/settle variation: `--dof` ramps to 0 as the zoom recedes, same timeline position as the pull)
- oversized partial glyphs descending / text scaling down through the frame → no element tween — authored static in world space; `viewport-change`'s pull produces the motion (author trap: animating the letters separately double-moves them)
- organic blob flow + morph into wavy line → SVG path morph — see `hyperframes-keyframes` (morph); flagged special, like `device-surface-showcase`'s WebGL specials — substitute a non-morph accent when the capability isn't loaded
- squiggle-underline residual undulation → `sine-wave-loop` (finite bounded undulation)
- circular petals pop/expand outward (bloom) → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered pops) + `center-outward-expansion` (petals expand from the hub to final positions)
- rows pop in top-to-bottom → `spring-pop-entrance` (staggered group, ≤500ms stagger cap) or `gsap-effects` (low-drama fade + short slide stagger)
- selection highlight steps down row-by-row → `gsap-effects` (stepped `tl.set` repositions at time thresholds — instant steps, no glide; trivial, no dedicated rule needed)
- new row fades/slides in → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft variant); its panel growing to fit → `anchored-layout-expand` (one-axis layout expansion)
- cursor enters off-frame → glides → hovers → clicks → `cursor-click-ripple` (move-to-target, co-depress, ripple); soft hover row-highlight → `gsap-effects` (background-color/opacity tween)
- timeline playhead scrub left-to-right → `gsap-effects` (linear `ease:"none"` translateX); in-sync canvas animation = place the artwork tweens at the same timeline position as the scrub (sync is free on one paused timeline)
- in-canvas rotation about a hub / spin-in-place (petal flower, starburst) → `svg-icon-enrichment` (SVG `setAttribute('transform','rotate(deg cx cy)')` for explicit centers)
- motif shift/sweep-in on a card → `gsap-effects` (masked translate) or `techniques.md` clip-path reveal
- file-attachment card fade-in → `spring-pop-entrance` (soft) / `gsap-effects` fade
- pane content swap via quick white-out → `discrete-text-sequence` (whole-state swap at a threshold) + `gsap-effects` (white flash overlay with attack-decay opacity envelope)
- pane expands full-width over neighbor (layout motion) → `anchored-layout-expand` (one-axis layout hand-off; width/height tweens stay forbidden)
- checklist items struck-through / status states → static content, or `discrete-text-sequence` if they check off on screen
- long static hold + cursor drift to rest → hold needs no rule; the drift is a single slow `gsap-effects` translate that ARRIVES somewhere meaningful (rests near the payoff stat) — it performs, it is not idle wobble
- ends mid-action (Hook) → the playhead/canvas tweens simply run to the composition edge — no exit move, no rule

**camera law — staging the one move** (the camera is the engine here, not a modifier)

- Build the ENTIRE `[whole]` workspace at final layout inside one `.world` wrapper; there is no second set. The open is `cam.scale = S0` (typically 4–12× — whatever makes the `[detail]` full-bleed) with counter-translate centering the detail; the reveal tweens to `scale 1, translate 0`. `overflow: hidden` on the scene; background on the scene, never the world.
- Crispness constraint: everything visible at open must survive S0 magnification — author the detail as DOM/vector (text, SVG, CSS shapes); any raster inside the close-up needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S0`.
- Sub-shape A: the reveal tween spans ~0–4.5s with `expo.out`-class deceleration — one tween, no phases, no cuts; element beats (morph, bloom, glyph settle) are positioned along it.
- Sub-shape B: optional gentle pre-reveal pan/pull (`viewport-change` pan, or a slow scale ease-out ≤ ~15% travel) during the dwell, then the reveal burst (~0.5–1s, heavy decel) as its own tween; camera fully static after.
- Never: a zoom-in, a second zoom-out, camera motion after the lock, or replacing the reveal with a cut. One outward move is the whole grammar.

**boundary vs `grid-card-assemble`**: it already carries an optional zoom-OUT reveal modifier (glass-card / logo-wall variants), so the two shapes border each other. The test: if elements ASSEMBLE and the pull-back merely shows the assembled array in context, it's `grid-card-assemble`; if the world is whole from frame 0 and the single decelerating pull-back is itself the story — close-up mystery → nesting reveal → locked-frame payoff — it's this blueprint. Related evidence: a mined profile-page golden runs the same single UI zoom-out/scroll-up reveal at small scale inside a kinetic-type shot, corroborating the move's currency without sharing the shape.

# Multi-Phase Camera

A camera wrapper around the ENTIRE scene that progresses through discrete zoom phases at scripted triggers, with continuous sine-driven micro-drift overlaid so the camera never feels static between phases. Distinct from a single linear zoom — multi-phase creates cinematic pacing (anticipation → reveal → settle).

## How It Works

The camera is one wrapping `<div>` whose `transform: scale() translate(x, y)` is composed from two channels inside a single `onUpdate` writer:

1. **Phase scale** — a proxy object `{ scale }` stepped through phases at trigger times (`PHASE_1_SCALE` at t=0 → `PHASE_2_SCALE` at `PHASE_2_AT` → `PHASE_3_SCALE` at `PHASE_3_AT`).
2. **Drift offset** — a continuous sine-based `translateX` / `translateY` (small amplitude, slow frequency) ADDED to the phase transform. X and Y run at slightly different frequencies (`DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO ≈ 1.3`) — equal frequencies produce a perfect diagonal that reads mechanical; ~1.3 gives an organic Lissajous.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="camera" id="camera">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta">{ctaText}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any phase scale < 1 exposes the content's edges */
  background: {sceneBgColor}; /* background on .scene, NOT .camera — a camera-borne
     background warps/translates with the transform and reveals the outer void */
}
.camera {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* off-center origin creates phase-to-phase drift */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const camera = document.getElementById("camera");

// Three-phase scale plan: pullback → focus → push.
const phase = { scale: PHASE_1_SCALE }; // Phase 1 is the initial value — no tween

// Phase 2 — settle to neutral focus
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_2_SCALE, duration: PHASE_2_DUR, ease: PHASE_2_EASE }, PHASE_2_AT);

// Phase 3 — slow push-in for the climax
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_3_SCALE, duration: PHASE_3_DUR, ease: PHASE_3_EASE }, PHASE_3_AT);

// Drift driver — continuous sine motion overlaid on the phase scale.
// The ONE writer of camera.style.transform.
const drift = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  drift,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * DRIFT_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION, // spans the whole composition
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const dx = Math.sin(drift.p) * DRIFT_AMP_X;
      const dy = Math.sin(drift.p * DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO) * DRIFT_AMP_Y;
      camera.style.transform = `scale(${phase.scale}) translate(${dx}px, ${dy}px)`;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Content reveals happen INSIDE the camera frame (hero/tagline/cta beats).
```

## Phase Patterns

| Pattern             | Scale sequence (1 → 2 → 3)        | Feel                            | When to use                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Focus-in**        | back → neutral → slight push      | Approach → settle → slight push | Default product reveal        |
| **Dramatic reveal** | push → neutral → pull             | Wide → focus → settle back      | Hero shot with breathing room |
| **Steady push**     | neutral → slight push → more push | Gradual forward momentum        | Continuous narrative push     |
| **Bookend pull**    | neutral → strong push → neutral   | Settle → push → release         | CTA emphasis then release     |

## Variations

- **Phase trigger by content beat**: align a camera tween's start with a content tween's end (entry completes → push begins) rather than a fixed clock value.
- **Camera shake (panic / impact)**: a brief higher-amplitude, higher-frequency drift tween over a short window — same `drift` mechanism with `SHAKE_AMP` / `SHAKE_CYCLES` / `SHAKE_DUR` at `SHAKE_AT`.
- **Targeted zoom into an off-center element**: combine scale with counter-translation so the target lands at viewport center — divide the measured offset by the current scale before feeding it into the writer:

```js
const tRect = document.querySelector(".cta").getBoundingClientRect();
const offsetX = (STAGE_W / 2 - (tRect.left + tRect.width / 2)) / phase.scale;
const offsetY = (STAGE_H / 2 - (tRect.top + tRect.height / 2)) / phase.scale;
// then in onUpdate: translate(offsetX + dx, offsetY + dy)
```

| PHASE_1 / 2 / 3_SCALE       | 0.88–0.96 / 0.98–1.02 / 1.04–1.15        | tighter spread = subtler camera; scale < 1 REQUIRES `overflow: hidden` on `.scene`  |
| PHASE_2_AT / PHASE_2_DUR    | 0.3–1.0s / 1.0–1.8s                      | longer DUR = slower settle, more cinematic                                          |
| PHASE_3_AT / PHASE_3_DUR    | 2.0–4.0s / 1.0–2.0s                      | PHASE_3_AT ≥ PHASE_2_AT + PHASE_2_DUR or focus is preempted                         |
| PHASE_2_EASE / PHASE_3_EASE | `power2.out` `power3.out` `power2.inOut` | spring/back easing on a camera feels uncomfortable; each later phase settles deeper |

| DRIFT_CYCLES                | 1–3                                      | 1 = one slow breath; high values read as mechanical wobble                          |
| DRIFT_AMP_X / DRIFT_AMP_Y   | 2–8 px / 1–4 px                          | imperceptible per-frame, visible over time — if it reads as a shake, it's too much  |
| DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO            | 1.2–1.5                                  | 1.0 = perfect diagonal (mechanical); ~1.3 = organic Lissajous                       |
| HERO_AT (etc.)              | after Phase-2 settle lands               | a hero fading in mid-pull-back feels like it's flying away                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **Camera wraps EVERYTHING in the scene** — a per-element camera creates parallax bugs and breaks the "one viewpoint" read.
- **One writer**: phase scale and drift compose inside the single drift `onUpdate`; nothing else touches `camera.style.transform`.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`** — required whenever any phase scale < 1.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.camera`** — off-center origin creates unpredictable phase-to-phase drift.
- **Scene background on `.scene`, not `.camera`** — otherwise scaling/translating reveals the outer void.
- **Hero reveal starts AFTER the initial pull-back ease lands** — otherwise the headline feels like it's flying away.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

## Values

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
